    <p class="message">
      I don’t even know where to begin because words will never do justice to what I feel for you. From the very first moment our paths crossed, something changed in me. The way you smile, the way you laugh, the way you care — it all feels like magic. You’re not just beautiful on the outside, but your heart, your soul, your energy — it lights up every space you walk into. Every day I wake up with a thought of you in my heart and a smile on my face because you exist. You make me want to be the best version of myself. You make me believe in love — the real, deep, forever kind of love. And today, I’m not just writing to tell you how special you are to me, I’m writing because I want to take a leap... a leap toward something even more beautiful. So let me ask you, with all my heart and all the love I can give — will you be mine?
